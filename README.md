# 🌿 Project: TAZDAYTH - Kabyle Gold

This project is a full-stack e-commerce website for Kabyle olive oil. It includes a modern Vite/React frontend and a robust Node/Express/TypeScript backend.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)

To run the project for the first time, follow these steps:

### 1. **MongoDB Connection**
Ensure you have **MongoDB** installed and running on your system (`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/tazdayth`).

### **Super Easy Mode**
If you want to start both the Frontend and Backend at the same time:
```bash
npm run dev:all
```

### 2. **Backend Setup**
Open a terminal in the `server` directory:
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run seed   # This populates wilayas and oil prices
npm run dev    # This starts the backend on port 5000
```

### 3. **Frontend Setup**
Open another terminal in the root directory:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # This starts the frontend, usually on port 8080 or 5173
```
